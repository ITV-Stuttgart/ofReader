# ofReader - Python Library for OpenFOAM

Python functions to read OpenFOAM data for post processing.

## Installation

Starting with version 4.0 the project uses the TOML file for project builds.

1. Make sure you have the required packages installed:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
   ```
2. Use `pip install .` to install the **ofReader** package.

## Usage

After installing the python library import it with

```python
from ofReader import sampleLineReader

# Load data from a sample line
data = sampleLineReader('../postProcessing/sample/line_alpha.liquid_k_rho_sigma.csv')
# Access data sets by name of the field, e.g.:
# data['x'] => for position
# data['alpha.liquid'] => for the liquid.alpha field
# data['k'] => for the turb. kin. energy
```

## Load OpenFOAM Fields and Mesh

The OpenFOAM fields can be read with
```python
from ofReader.ofFileReader import readOpenFOAMFile
# E.g. read the velocity field of time step 0.005s
pathToFile = '0.005/U'
eulerianData = readOpenFOAMFile(pathToFile)

# To load a decomposed OpenFOAM file use
velocity = readOpenFOAMFile('/path/to/case',fileName='U', time=0.05, decomposed=True)

# This also works for Lagrangian data
pathToLagrangianData = '0.005/lagrangian/cloudName/pos'
lagrangianData = readOpenFOAMFile(pathToFile)
```

For the Eulerian fields the position of the entries is stored in the fvMesh 
object. Therefore, an fvMesh python class is provided which can read the 
mesh and provides an interface for the cells:
```python
from ofReader.fvMesh import fvMesh
mesh = fvMesh(pathToCase)
# Get cell center points as list of arrays
center = mesh.centers()
```
> [!TIP]
> However, the class is very slow and time consuming, if only the position of the
> cells is of interest use the built in `postProcess -func writeCellCentres` function of 
> OpenFOAM.


## Write OpenFOAM File

To write a data block as an OpenFOAM file, a file header and boundaries have
to be defined.

```python
# First create an OpenFOAM file header
ofFileFormat header
# Store a scalar field
header.type = "scalar"

# Create a list of boundaries
# Currently still WIP, best to use empty
ofBoundaryData boundary
boundary.addPatch('inlet','empty')

# dimensions of the field in OpenFOAM format
fieldDimensions = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

# Write OpenFOAM file
writeOpenFOAMFile('Path/to/file',
    header,
    dataBlock,
    boundary,
    fieldDimensions)
```


## Sample Particle Data to Plane

In Lagrangian simulations, a common use case is to map particle data onto a plane â€” particularly useful for circumferential or axisymmetric setups. For this purpose, the `MapParticleToPlane` class is provided.

This class allows you to:

- Define an arbitrary sampling plane via a point and normal vector.
- Project particle data (e.g., position, velocity, diameter) onto that plane.
- Export the sampled data for visualization or further analysis.

### Basic Usage

```python
from ofReader.mapParticleToPlane import MapParticleToPlane

mapper = MapParticleToPlane(
    path_to_case="path/to/case",
    time="latestTime",
    plane_origin=[0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
    plane_normal=[0.0, 0.0, 1.0]
)

sampled_data = mapper.sample()
```

The returned sampled_data is a dictionary containing the projected particle properties.

> [!NOTE]
> This class is particularly useful for post-processing particle-laden flows simulated with OpenFOAM.

## Tests

```bash
pip install .[test]
```
Run the tests with:
```bash
